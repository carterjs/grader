Grader
======
A sleek and intuitive grading tool for teachers

Installation
============
After you have dowloaded Grader:

1. Move the folder to a location where it cannot be accidentally deleted or lost such as your desktop or documents folder

2. Open the folder and open either 'index' or 'index.html' (some computers may hide file extension)

3. Treat the page like a website and save it to favorites or set it as your homepage

4. Whenever you want to use it, either select it in favorites or reopen either 'index' or 'index.html'

Tips
====

* As long as you are not currently typing in a text field, you can press 'q' to return to the 'Number of questions' box, or 'i' to return to the 'Number incorrect' box.

* To see the un-rounded version of any grade, you can hover over it, but beware, binary doesn't always play well with decimals.
